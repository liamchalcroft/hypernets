# hypunet

This repo implements hypernetworks for parametrisation of the nnUNet library. Because of this, the majority of the syntax and documentation will follow exactly from nnUNet, however with 'nnunet' swapped out for 'hypunet' on commands. For this reason, we recommend referring to the [nnUNet (v1) Documentation](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/tree/nnunetv1).

## Installation

The library may be installed with the command:

`pip install git+https://github.com/liamchalcroft/hypernets`
